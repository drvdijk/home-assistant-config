# Our Home Assistant Configuration

This is a first stab at putting our Home Assistant configuration in a git repository.
The idea is to follow the concept from [Frenck's configuration](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config) as it was at his commit [e75614b](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config/commit/e75614b61c20fb2f60a652ae5dd993559b8d2830).
